# DelayLlama
### Crypto Correlation Alert System with Delayed Signals:

## Demo:
- on streamlit cloud : [Delay-Llama](https://delayllama.streamlit.app/)

## Project Description: 
Creating a vocal assistant that can provide traders with real-time insights and recommendations in a conversational manner on the cryptocurrencies market

1-**Voice Interaction:** Integrate a voice recognition system to allow users to interact with the vocal assistant verbally. Users can ask questions and receive responses through speech.

2- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Connect the vocal assistant to real-time cryptocurrency market data sources to provide up-to-the-minute information on prices, trends, and volumes.

3- **Market Overview:** When users ask about the market, the vocal assistant can provide an overview of the current state, including the overall sentiment (bullish, bearish, or neutral) and the performance of major cryptocurrencies.

4- **Correlation Insights:** The vocal assistant can explain correlations it has identified. For example, it can mention that Bitcoin and XRP are both performing well, but caution that they are approaching weekly resistance levels.

5- **Trading Recommendations:** When users inquire about which cryptocurrency to long or short, the vocal assistant can suggest options based on its analysis. In your example, it recommends watching SXP due to increased volatility and its proximity to support.

6- **Risk Assessment:** Include a risk assessment in the recommendations. The vocal assistant can mention potential risks associated with each recommendation, such as market volatility or upcoming events.

7- **User Queries:** Users should be able to ask follow-up questions or seek clarification. The vocal assistant should provide detailed responses and explanations as needed.

8- **Portfolio Management:** Extend the vocal assistant's capabilities to allow users to manage their cryptocurrency portfolios. Users can instruct the assistant to buy, sell, or adjust positions.

7- **Continuous Updates:** The vocal assistant should provide regular updates as market conditions change. For example, it can notify users if the market sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish.

8- **Customization:** Allow users to customize their preferences and risk tolerance. The vocal assistant can tailor its recommendations based on the user's profile and trading strategy.

9- **Privacy and Security:** Ensure robust security measures to protect user data, especially since this involves financial information and trading recommendations.

10- **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a feedback mechanism where users can provide feedback on the vocal assistant's recommendations, helping to improve its accuracy over time.

## Demo project
A project demo to be built within a tight three-day timeline, should focuss on essential components and features to showcase the core functionality of the cryptocurrency correlation vocal assistant. Here's the streamlined plan:

1. User Interface (UI):

Develop a minimalistic text-based interface where users can type queries and receive text responses. While voice recognition is a valuable feature, it may require additional time for setup and integration.

2. Market Data Integration:

Connect to a limited set of cryptocurrency market data sources to fetch real-time data for a few major cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum).

3. Data Analysis:

Implement a simplified data analysis module that demonstrates the concept of identifying correlations between two cryptocurrencies with a minor delay.

4. Recommendation Engine:

Create a basic recommendation engine that generates hypothetical trading signals for a limited number of cryptocurrency pairs based on the simplified correlation analysis.

5. Text-based Responses:

Develop a text-based response system where the vocal assistant provides recommendations and explanations in a textual format.

6. Demo Scenario:

Prepare a scripted demo scenario where we can interact with the application by typing queries, receiving recommendations, and explaining the process to showcase the core functionality.

7. User Interaction Logs:

Implement basic logging of user interactions to show how queries are processed and how recommendations are generated.

8. Simple Risk Assessment:

Include a simplified risk assessment component that highlights the importance of considering risk factors when trading.

9. Educational Content:

Create concise educational content within the application that explains the concept of delayed correlations and how the application generates recommendations.

10. Presentation Materials:
- Prepare presentation slides or materials that visually demonstrate the application's architecture and functionality.

11. Testing and Quality Assurance:
- Thoroughly test the core features to ensure they work as intended for the demo.
